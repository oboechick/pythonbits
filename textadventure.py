def displayIntro():
	# Code your start paragraph here
	# How do you make your code display on the screen for the user?
	# Leave a break so that the next part is more visible.

# Ask the user a question then write code that takes user input. 
# I can think of 2 ways this can be done. There is no "right" way, 
# there are many ways so long as they work.

# Use conditionals to follow your flowchart using the user's input.

# Challenge: Write a function called 'playAgain' this will start the game over.
